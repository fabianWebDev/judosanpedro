    aboutSenseisDescription:
        "Our senseis combine years of judo experience with a constant dedication to teaching. They pass on the values of the dojo and guide each student on their martial path. Beyond technique, they transmit the fundamental values of the dojo — respect, discipline and perseverance — and accompany each student closely in their physical, mental and personal development along their martial journey.",
